1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
Currently, it is fine for it to stay a string, because there is no excess data that is required to be stored.


2. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?
Encancements makes to this project that would be made is to add developers, a description, and deadlines. This would change the answer for the first question as we would need it to be a class, not a string.
